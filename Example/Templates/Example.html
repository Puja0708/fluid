<f:layout name="Default" />

Explanation
====

This is the main Template. It belongs to a specific Layout (called Default in this case)
and contains one Section (Main) which will be rendered from the Layout.

This makes the Template optimal to use as the body content of the page and the Layout
is ideal for menus, header, shared body content such as bread crumbs and the likes.

<f:section name="Main">
    Hello world. Very original!
</f:section>
